% \subsection*{Background and Significance of the Study}

\hspace{\parindent}Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches system development 
by emphasizing models over source code. Through modeling languages such as UML 
and OCL, developers construct models that abstract the system complexity and serve as primary development artifacts. 
These models can then be transformed into executable code, documentation, and test cases using automated 
model transformation techniques. Techniques like validation and verification help 
ensure the models’ quality, with structural aspects, represented by class and object 
diagrams, being particularly important.

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) offers a standard way to create diagrams that show 
a system’s structure and behavior, while the Object Constraint Language (OCL) adds precise 
rules to these models. OCL uses simple logic to define conditions that must always be true 
or requirements for operations. However, it lacks the expressive power to model temporal properties 
that involve different states of the model or depend on event occurrences. 
This limitation stems from the absence of built-in constructs for handling time and events in OCL.

% \subsection*{Research Objectives}

In this work, we aim to extend OCL to support temporal properties and events,

% Model-driven engineering (MDE) takes a view on system development focusing on
% models than on code. Using modeling languages like UML and OCL, developers create models 
% that abstract the system’s complexity and serve as the central artifacts 
% in MDE. From these models, code, documentation, and test cases can be 
% automatically generated through model transformations. Techniques like validation 
% and verification help ensure the models’ quality, with structural aspects - 
% represented by class and object diagrams - being particularly important.

% Traditional software engineering, reliant on manual coding, 
% struggles with increasingly large, complex projects despite aiming for reliable and efficient systems. 
% This causes inefficiencies not from software requirements but from development 
% process limitations, driving the need for simpler, more flexible approaches. 
% To address these challenges, 
% Model Driven Engineering (MDE) \cite{MDE} offers a promising methodology 
% aimed at reducing accidental complexities by focusing on models over code.
