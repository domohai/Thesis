% The core of our contribution lies in the transformation of TOCL+ 
% expressions into equivalent OCL constraints that can be verified over filmstrip 
% models. This transformation process involves systematically mapping temporal operators 
% and event constructs to structural navigations through snapshots and operation calls. 
% In this section, we describe our implementation approach and the key translation 
% patterns we developed.
