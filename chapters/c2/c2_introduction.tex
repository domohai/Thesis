\section{Introduction}

\hspace{1cm} OCL provides strong support for structural properties in UML models but 
falls short when specifying dynamic system behavior. Operating only on single states 
or individual transitions, OCL cannot express properties spanning multiple states or 
responding to system events. This limitation is significant for modern systems 
requiring temporal and reactive behaviors.

Temporal logics like LTL and CTL offer formal frameworks for temporal properties but 
require specialized knowledge unfamiliar to most UML designers. This creates a practical 
barrier for practitioners comfortable with UML/OCL but not with formal temporal notations.

This chapter presents two main contributions:

First, TOCL+ extends OCL with temporal and event capabilities. It adds temporal 
operators like \textit{always}, \textit{sometime}, and \textit{until} for reasoning 
about system evolution over time, and introduces event constructs for detecting 
specific system occurrences such as operation calls and state changes. TOCL+ maintains 
OCL's familiar syntax while enabling complex dynamic specifications.

Second, we introduce a transformation approach that enables verification of TOCL+ 
specifications using existing tools. This approach transforms UML/OCL models into 
filmstrip models representing state sequences, and translates TOCL+ specifications 
into standard OCL constraints verifiable within these models.

The chapter is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Section 2.2 presents the TOCL+ language extension, covering temporal 
    operators, event constructs, and their integration.
    
    \item Section 2.3 details the transformation approach, explaining the model 
    transformation and specification translation processes.
\end{itemize}

Together, these contributions provide a complete solution for both specifying and 
verifying temporal properties within the model-driven engineering paradigm.
