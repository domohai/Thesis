\textbf{Abstract:} In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), models serve as primary artifacts 
for abstracting and designing software systems. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) and 
the Object Constraint Language (OCL) are widely used for specifying structural and 
behavioral properties of these models. However, OCL has fundamental limitations in 
expressing properties that span multiple system states or involve event occurrences, 
making it challenging to specify and verify dynamic aspects of systems. This thesis 
addresses these limitations by introducing TOCL+ (Temporal OCL+), an extension of OCL 
with temporal operators and event constructs. TOCL+ enables developers to specify 
complex temporal properties such as safety and liveness constraints using familiar 
OCL syntax, while incorporating temporal logic concepts. We present a systematic 
transformation approach that converts TOCL+ expressions into standard OCL constraints 
interpreted over filmstrip modelsâ€”representations of system execution paths as 
sequences of snapshots. This transformation enables verification of temporal 
properties using existing OCL tools without requiring specialized temporal logic
model checkers. We implement this approach as a plugin for the UML-based Specification 
Environment (USE) tool and demonstrate its effectiveness through a software system 
case study, showing how our approach bridges the gap between intuitive temporal 
specification and practical model verification.
