\section{Introduction}

\hspace{1cm} In the previous chapter, we introduced TOCL+, an extension of OCL with temporal operators and event constructs, and presented a theoretical framework for specifying and verifying temporal properties in UML models. While the formal semantics and verification approach provide a solid foundation, they require practical tool support to be effectively applied. This chapter bridges the gap between theory and practice by presenting our implementation of a TOCL+ plugin for the USE tool and demonstrating its effectiveness through a detailed case study.

The primary objective of this chapter is twofold. First, we describe the implementation of our TOCL+ plugin for the USE tool, which enables modelers to specify temporal properties using our extended language and automatically verify them using the filmstrip approach. Second, we demonstrate the practical application of TOCL+ through a detailed case study of the Software System model introduced in Chapter 2, showcasing how various types of temporal properties can be effectively specified and verified.

In the following sections, we present the architecture and implementation of our plugin, focusing on how it integrates with the USE tool environment and implements the transformation process described in Chapter 2. We then explore the Software System case study, illustrating how our approach handles the specification and verification of different types of temporal properties in practice.
