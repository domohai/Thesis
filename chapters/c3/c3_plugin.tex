\hspace{1cm} Figure \ref{sec:plugin_support_tool_architecture} illustrates the 
architecture and workflow of our TOCL+ support tool. This integrated verification 
framework combines several components: the existing USE environment, the Filmstrip 
plugin, our TOCL+ plugin, and the Model Validator. The architecture maintains a 
clear separation between modeling, specification, and verification concerns while 
providing a cohesive workflow for users.

The verification process consists of five distinct steps, beginning with preparation 
and ending with validation. First, the user prepares two input files: a standard 
\texttt{.use} file containing the UML/OCL application model and a \texttt{.tocl} 
file containing TOCL+ property specifications. Second, the user loads the application 
model into USE to make it available for transformation. Third, the user activates 
our plugin through the USE interface, selecting both a destination path for the 
output model and the \texttt{.tocl} file containing the temporal properties to verify.

Internally, the plugin then executes a two-phase transformation process. In the 
first phase, it invokes the Filmstrip plugin to transform the application model 
into a filmstrip model following the rules described in Section~\ref{subsec:filmstripping}. 
In the second phase, it processes the TOCL+ expressions using our ANTLR4-generated 
parser and listener components, which implement the transformation rules for 
converting temporal specifications into equivalent OCL constraints. These generated 
constraints are added to the list of invariants in the output model file alongside 
the filmstrip model elements.

To complete the verification process, the user loads this output model back into 
USE together with a configuration file that establishes search bounds, and then 
employs the Model Validator to analyze the constraints. The validator systematically 
explores the search space, determining whether the temporal properties are satisfied 
and providing a model instance as evidence when applicable.

Our primary contribution in this architecture is the TOCL+ plugin, specifically 
the TOCL+ to OCL transformation component that enables the verification of temporal 
properties using existing OCL tools. The implementation details of this transformation 
process, including the translation rules for different temporal operators and event 
constructs, are presented in the next subsection.

\subsection{Implementation of TOCL+ to OCL Transformation}

\hspace{1cm} The core of our contribution lies in the transformation of TOCL+ 
expressions into equivalent OCL constraints that can be verified over filmstrip 
models. This transformation process involves systematically mapping temporal operators 
and event constructs to structural navigations through snapshots and operation calls. 
In this section, we describe our implementation approach and the key translation 
patterns we developed.

Our transformation approach is inspired by the work of \cite{TOCL2OCL}, who 
transformed TOCL \cite{TOCL} into OCL in the context of a Snapshot-Transition Model 
(STM). While their approach also converts temporal properties into static ones, we 
adapted and extended it to work within the filmstrip model context.

To transform TOCL+ expressions, we defined translations for TOCL+ operators and 
events to OCL, as shown in Table \ref{tab:TOCL2OCL}. To create these translations, 
we utilized several query operations provided by the filmstrip structure. 
The self.snapshot query accesses the snapshot associated with an object in the 
"current state" where the expression is being evaluated. The pred() and succ() 
operations, when applied to a snapshot, navigate to the previous and next state 
respectively. For objects to navigate to their corresponding versions in adjacent 
states, we use the two associations .pred and .succ. These navigation mechanisms 
form the foundation for implementing our temporal operator translations.

Note that filmstrip model does not inherently provide any means to identify the same 
logical object across different states - it only provides the .pred and .succ 
associations to navigate between corresponding objects in adjacent snapshots. 
In order to overcome this limitation, we require modelers to add an id attribute 
to all classes in the application model. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:object_diagram_liveness}, 
this allows us to identify the same logical object across different snapshots. 
Internally, when the TOCL+ plugin transforms the model, we add additional 
constraints to ensure this id remains consistent between different states. 
This id attribute is critical in the OCL translation, particularly for event 
constructs like becomesTrue. When navigating with expressions like 
self.snapshot.pred().[ContextObject], we get a collection of objects of the same 
type, and we select the one with matching identity using ->any(o | o.id = self.id).

Table \ref{tab:TOCL2OCL} presents the complete set of translation patterns we 
developed for TOCL+ operators and event constructs. Each pattern systematically 
maps a TOCL+ construct to an equivalent OCL expression interpreted over the filmstrip 
model. The patterns use placeholders (indicated by square brackets) that get 
substituted during the transformation process: \texttt{[s |= P]} indicates that 
property P holds in snapshot s; \texttt{[ContextSnapshot]} is the snapshot in which 
the property is evaluated; \texttt{[ContextObject]} is the object on which the 
property is evaluated; and \texttt{[OpClassName]} is the class representing an 
operation call in the filmstrip model. When applying these patterns, each placeholder 
is replaced with the appropriate expression based on the model context. For example, 
in the liveness property translation shown in Listing \ref{lst:ocl_liveness}, the 
\texttt{[ContextSnapshot]} is replaced with the local variable \texttt{s} inside the 
\texttt{exists} query. The bounded quantifiers (e.g., \texttt{at most}, \texttt{at least}) 
are translated into corresponding comparators (\texttt{<=}, \texttt{>=}). 
The bounded quantifiers in TOCL+ expressions are systematically translated into their 
corresponding OCL comparators: \texttt{at most} becomes less than or equal to 
(\texttt{<=}), while \texttt{at least} becomes greater than or equal to (\texttt{>=}). 
For bounded existence properties without an explicit quantifier (e.g., 
\texttt{isCalled(Op()) 3 times}), the translation applies the equality operator 
(\texttt{=}), enforcing that the event occurs exactly the specified number of times. 
In contrast, when dealing with unbounded event expressions without quantifiers (e.g., 
simply \texttt{isCalled(Op())}), the translation converts the \texttt{select} operation 
into an \texttt{exists} operation, requiring only that the event occurs at least once 
rather than counting occurrences.
    
We implemented the transformation using ANTLR4, a parser generator that creates a 
parse tree from TOCL+ expressions. After defining the translation patterns shown 
in Table \ref{tab:TOCL2OCL}, we created Java listener classes that extend the 
generated parser listeners. The transformation process employs these listener 
components to traverse the parse tree and produce corresponding OCL expressions 
by overriding the generated listener methods. As the parser walks through each node 
in the parse tree, our listeners intercept parse tree events and apply the appropriate 
translation rules, constructing equivalent OCL constraints that navigate through 
the filmstrip structure. The transformation follows a consistent pattern: when a 
temporal operator or event construct is encountered, the listener extracts relevant 
information from the parse tree nodes, applies the corresponding translation pattern, 
and builds the equivalent OCL expression. Our implementation maintains a stack of 
expressions to handle nested structures, pushing both the original TOCL+ expression 
and its OCL translation for later integration into the output model.
Listing \ref{lst:becomesTrue_translation} provides an example of this process for 
the \texttt{becomesTrue} event construct, showing how we extract the expression 
to be evaluated, establish the necessary context, and construct the translated OCL 
expression. 

After processing all the nodes in the parse tree, our implementation finalizes the 
translation in the root node visit. Since TOCL+ is an extension of OCL, many 
constructs remain unchanged and are directly preserved during translation. The 
completion process begins by accessing the token stream to retrieve the complete 
original expression text. Our implementation then systematically pops each translated 
OCL fragment and its corresponding original TOCL+ expression from the stack. Using 
string replacement operations, it substitutes each temporal construct with its 
equivalent OCL translation while preserving the structure of the original expression. 
This approach allows us to handle nested temporal operators naturally, as inner 
expressions are processed before their containing expressions. The final translated 
OCL constraint is then attached to the root of the parse tree and ultimately added 
to the output model as an invariant. This complete process ensures that complex 
temporal properties are accurately transformed into standard OCL constraints that 
can be verified by the Model Validator.
