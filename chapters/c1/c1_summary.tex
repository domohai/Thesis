\section{Summary}
\hspace{1cm} This chapter has established the conceptual and technical foundations necessary for understanding our approach to temporal specification and verification. We explored the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the standard visual notation for modeling object-oriented systems, and examined the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and its role in expressing precise constraints, highlighting its inherent limitations regarding temporal propertiesâ€”particularly its inability to express constraints across multiple system states and event occurrences. We then presented the UML-based Specification Environment (USE) and its critical extensions: the Model Validator Plugin for automated constraint checking and the Filmstrip Plugin for transforming dynamic properties into statically verifiable constraints. This background reveals a significant gap in current modeling practices: while OCL effectively expresses structural constraints, it lacks constructs for temporal specifications essential for reactive and event-driven systems. The filmstripping approach provides a promising verification foundation, but requires corresponding specification mechanisms to fully address temporal properties. In the next chapter, we introduce TOCL+ as our solution to this specification challenge, extending OCL with temporal and event constructs while leveraging the filmstrip verification framework.
