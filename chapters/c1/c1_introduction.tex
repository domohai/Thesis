\section{Introduction}

\hspace{1cm} This chapter presents fundamentals about concepts and artifacts essential 
to this thesis. The modeling languages such as, Unified Modeling Language (UML), 
together with Object Constraint Language (OCL), are used to describe structural and 
behavioral aspects of systems and are briefly described in this chapter. A description 
of the modeling and specification tool called UML-based Specification Environment (USE)
is presented, including its model validation capabilities that form the foundation for 
our verification approach. We explain the filmstrip model transformation process in 
detail, as it serves as the underlying mechanism for our temporal verification approach.
