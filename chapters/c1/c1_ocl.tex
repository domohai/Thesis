\section{Object Constraint Language (OCL)}

\subsection{Overview}

\hspace{1cm} As explained in Sect. 2.1, UML is a graphical language for visualization of the system
state. But visual modeling with the UML alone is not enough for the development of
accurate and consistent software model. For this reason, Object Management Group
(OMG), in 1997, developed Object Constraint Language (OCL), which describes 
expressions on UML models and thus extends further the functionality of UML [60].
